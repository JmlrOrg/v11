    "abstract": "The SGD-QN algorithm described in Bordes et al. (2009)\ncontains a subtle flaw that prevents it from reaching its design goals.\nYet the flawed SGD-QN algorithm has worked well enough to be a winner of the first\nPascal Large Scale Learning Challenge (Sonnenburg et al., 2008).\nThis document clarifies the situation, proposes a corrected algorithm,\nand evaluates its performance.",
