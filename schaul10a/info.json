    "abstract": "PyBrain is a versatile machine learning library for Python. Its goal is to provide\nflexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful algorithms for machine learning tasks, including\na variety of predefined environments and benchmarks to test and compare \nalgorithms. \nImplemented algorithms include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), policy gradient methods, (multidimensional) \nrecurrent neural networks and deep belief networks.",
