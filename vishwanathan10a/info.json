    "abstract": "We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases\nof which include the random walk (G&#228;rtner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005)\nand marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mah&#233;t al., 2004) \ngraph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the\ntime complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with \n<i>n</i> vertices from <i>O(n<sup>6</sup>)</i> to <i>O(n<sup>3</sup>)</i>. We find a spectral\ndecomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel\nmatrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point\nmethods that take <i>O(dn<sup>3</sup>)</i> time per iteration, where <i>d</i> is the size of the\nlabel set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for <i>d</i>-dimensional edge\nkernels, and <i>O(n<sup>4</sup>)</i> in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs\nthese algorithms only take <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> time per iteration in all cases. Experiments\non graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that\nthese techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of\nmagnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels\n(Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs\nreduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our\nframework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a\nkernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of\nkernel of Fr&#246;hlich et al. (2006) yet provably positive semi-definite.",
