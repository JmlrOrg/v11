    "abstract": "We consider <i>selective classification</i>, a term we adopt here to refer to 'classification with a reject option.' The essence in selective classification is to trade-off classifier\ncoverage for higher accuracy.  We term this trade-off the <i>risk-coverage (RC) trade-off</i>.\nOur main objective is to characterize this trade-off and to construct algorithms that can optimally or near\noptimally achieve the best possible trade-offs in a controlled manner.\nFor noise-free models we present in this paper\na thorough analysis of selective classification including characterizations of RC trade-offs\nin various interesting settings.",
