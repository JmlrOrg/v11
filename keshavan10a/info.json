    "abstract": "Given a matrix <i>M</i> of low-rank, we consider the problem of\nreconstructing it from noisy observations of a small,\nrandom subset of its entries. The problem arises in a variety\nof applications, from collaborative filtering (the 'Netflix problem')\nto structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity algorithm\nintroduced by Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh (2010), based on a combination\nof spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call \nhere OPTSPACE. We prove performance guarantees that are \norder-optimal in a number of circumstances.",
