    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an open source Error-Correcting Output\nCodes (ECOC) library. The ECOC framework is a powerful tool to\ndeal with multi-class categorization problems. This library\ncontains both state-of-the-art coding (one-versus-one,\none-versus-all, dense random, sparse random, DECOC, forest-ECOC,\nand ECOC-ONE) and decoding designs (hamming, euclidean, inverse\nhamming, laplacian, &#946;-density, attenuated, loss-based,\nprobabilistic kernel-based, and loss-weighted) with the parameters\ndefined by the authors, as well as the option to include your own\ncoding, decoding, and base classifier.",
