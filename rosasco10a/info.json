    "abstract": "A large number of learning algorithms, for example, spectral clustering, kernel Principal Components Analysis and many \nmanifold methods are based on estimating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of operators defined \nby a similarity function or a kernel, given empirical data. Thus for the analysis of algorithms, it is an important \nproblem to be able to assess the  quality of such approximations.\nThe contribution of our paper is two-fold:\n<br>\n1. We use a technique based on a concentration inequality for Hilbert spaces to provide \nnew much simplified proofs for a number of results in  spectral approximation.\n<br>\n2. Using these methods we provide several new results for estimating spectral properties of the graph \nLaplacian operator extending and strengthening results from von Luxburg et al. (2008).",
