    "abstract": "We present a general method for explaining individual predictions\nof classification models. The method is based on fundamental\nconcepts from coalitional game theory and predictions are\nexplained with contributions of individual feature values. We\novercome the method's initial exponential time complexity with a\nsampling-based approximation. In the experimental part of the\npaper we use the developed method on models generated by several\nwell-known machine learning algorithms on both synthetic and\nreal-world data sets. The results demonstrate that the method is\nefficient and that the explanations are intuitive and useful.",
